Here\u2019s why you don\u2019t want to miss out.[More time in totality]An eclipse crossed the US in 2017, but totality only lasted up to 2 minutes 42 seconds. This time, the Moon will completely block the Sun for over 4 minutes in some areas.[The Sun is more active]2017 was a calm period for our Sun. But in 2024, it\u2019s much more active. That means there\u2019s a much better chance of seeing giant streamers, prominences, or even a solar eruption.[A wider path is more populated]This time, the Moon\u2019s shadow will be wider and will pass over more populated areas. Nearly 3 times as many people live within the path compared to the eclipse in 2017. There won\u2019t be another total eclipse crossing the US until 2045.So don\u2019t miss out!

It uses data starting in 1880, when coverage made it possible to reliably estimate global temperature.Despite 2023 being the globally hottest year, individual locations may not have experienced a record-warm year. However, the effects of our changing climate are felt around the globe, with record droughts, shifting fire seasons, and sudden, intense precipitation events.With more than 20 spacecraft and thousands of researchers studying Earth systems and the impacts of rising global temperatures, we\u2019re helping people prepare for life on Earth now and in the future.

Not only is the biggest planet in the solar system forever pulling at it gravitationally, but so are its Galilean siblings \u2013 Europa and the biggest moon in the solar system, Ganymede.

For both targets, Io and Jupiter, raw JunoCam images were reprojected into views similar to the perspective of a consumer camera. The Io flyby and the Jupiter approach movie were rendered separately and composed into a synchronous split-screen video.\u2063\u2063Launched on Aug. 5, 2011, Juno embarked on a 5-year journey to Jupiter. Its mission: to probe beneath the planet\u2019s dense clouds and answer questions about the origin and evolution of Jupiter, our solar system, and giant planets in general across the cosmos. Juno arrived at the gas giant on July 4, 2016, after a 1.7-billion-mile journey, and settled into a 53-day polar orbit stretching from just above Jupiter\u2019s cloud tops to the outer reaches of the Jovian magnetosphere.

Taken as waves of energetic particles from a solar storm were arriving at Mars, the sequence pauses at the end, when the wave of the most energetic particles arrived and overwhelmed the instrument with noise.\u2063 \u2063The way these auroras occur is different than those seen on Earth. Our home planet is shielded from charged particles by a robust magnetic field, which normally limits auroras to regions near the poles. (Solar maximum is the reason behind the recent auroras seen as far south as Alabama.) Mars lost its internally generated magnetic field in the ancient past, so there\u2019s no protection from the barrage of energetic particles. When charged particles hit the Martian atmosphere, it results in auroras that engulf the entire planet.\u2063 \u2063MAVEN took these images between May 14 and 20, 2024, as the spacecraft orbited below Mars, looking up at the nightside of the planet (Mars\u2019 south pole can be seen on the right, in full sunlight).

The T-38 is a two-engine jet that can hold two crew members together and reach speeds as high as Mach 1.2, making it faster than the speed of sound. The T-38, which can fly to heights of 50,000 feet/15,240 meters, is used for aerobatic maneuvers to help the astronauts become adjusted to unusual attitudes that they might experience in space. They also manage real risks in real time that helps prepare for quick decision making in the harsh environment of space. Since the Apollo era, astronauts have received dedicated training in the T-38.Working together in flight is similar to how the crew might work together in their Orion spacecraft. The Artemis II mission will send @NASAastronauts @Astro_Reid, @AstroVicGlover, and @astro_christina, and @CanadianSpaceAgency astronaut @AstroJeremy on a 10-day flight test around the Moon. This first crewed mission back to the Moon will set the tone as we look forward to establishing a long term presence on the lunar surface with #Artemis.

Astronauts can send requests to Mission Control for potential shows or events to watch during their dinner or off duty-time. Astronauts can be in orbit up to six months or more, so various forms of entertainment and staying connected with family, friends, and current events on the ground is important to help manage stress and feel stable.Good luck to both teams in the #CFBPlayoff tonight!PS: If astronauts used the @ISS as a football field (which are roughly the same size) they\u2019d have the fastest pass relative to Earth since the station orbits at 17,500 mph (25,000 kph).#NASA #ISS #InternationalSpaceStation#ESPN #Football #CFBPlayoff #Earth #Space"

Solar winds carry the energetically charged particles from these events to Earth\u2019s atmosphere. When these particles seep through Earth's magnetosphere, a part of our atmosphere that protects us from solar and cosmic radiation, they cause substorms. These fast-moving substorm particles slam into our thin, high atmosphere, colliding with Earth's oxygen and nitrogen particles. As these air particles shed the energy they picked up from the collision, each atom starts to glow in a different color\u2014causing the brilliant ribbons of light which weave across Earth's northern or southern polar regions. Typically, auroras are visible closer to Earth\u2019s poles, where the magnetosphere is generally weakest; however, when the Sun releases especially powerful solar storms, auroras can be seen further from the poles. Just that happened this past week when a powerful geomagnetic storm delighted skywatchers with auroras as far south as Virginia and Arizona! Video description: The northern lights as seen from the International Space Station. The video begins with the green hues of the northern lights dancing across the skies of North America. The curvature of the Earth is visible where the auroras in the atmosphere meet the darkness of space. As the video continues it moves further southeast across North America, revealing the bright lights of cities across the midwest United States.

An annular eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun. Unlike in a total solar eclipse, where the Moon covers up the Sun completely, the Moon is just distant enough during an annular eclipse to allow a thin bright ring of Sun to shine through.This clip shows the ring of fire as it passes over Albuquerque, New Mexico. Our 2023 annular eclipse show featured live views from California to Texas, interviews with scientists and NASA astronauts, and a sneak preview at the total solar eclipse set to cross over North America in April 2024. Watch the full program at youtube.com/NASA.Visual description:A telescope view of the annular solar eclipse shows the Moon as a black sphere moving across the slightly larger gold disc of the Sun, blocking most of the Sun, leaving only a thin crescent and then ring of light.

Planet VisibilityMercury: Visible very low in the southeast just before sunrise during the last half of the month.Venus: Shines brightly as the \"Evening Star\" in the southwest after sunset, climbing higher each evening.Mars: Brightens significantly during December, rising in the east-northeast and visible from late evening to early morning.Jupiter: Reaches opposition on Dec. 7, making it visible all night, rising in the east-northeast.Saturn: Visible after sunset in the southern sky, shifting slightly westward as the month progresses. HighlightsDec. 3-5 \u2013 Venus and the Moon: Look southwest after sunset to see a beautiful pairing. On Dec. 4, a slim crescent Moon will sit directly below Venus.Dec. 7 \u2013 Jupiter at Opposition: Jupiter will shine at its brightest for the year, rising in the east-northeast among Taurus's stars. Best viewed through a telescope for details like the Galilean moons and atmospheric belts.Dec. 14 \u2013 Jupiter, the Moon, and Aldebaran: Look for Jupiter midway between the nearly full Moon and bright orange star Aldebaran in the evening sky.Dec. 17 \u2013 Mars and the Moon: Mars, glowing brightly in its approach to opposition, appears super close to the waning gibbous Moon.All Month \u2013 Winter Triangle: Formed by Sirius, Procyon, and Betelgeuse, this asterism marks the arrival of winter skies and is a prominent feature throughout the season.Dec. 13-14 \u2013 Geminid Meteor Shower: The peak occurs under a nearly full Moon, reducing visibility, but bright meteors may still be spotted the week before.Dec. 21 \u2013 Winter Solstice: At 4:20 a.m. EST, the solstice marks the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in the Southern Hemisphere.
