Starting off, the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn are visible throughout the night in October. Early in the evening, you'll find them to the southeast, moving slowly westward with the stars over the course of the night. Looking to spot the full Moon? Our lunar companion will be in full illumination starting on Oct. 9 and will appear full for about three days. As the full moon after the Harvest Moon, this will be the Hunter's Moon, named that because historically during this period the harvesters have finished reaping the fields, allowing hunters easier sight of the animals that have come out to feed.  Next up, Mars has been steadily moving through the sky in an eastward fashion all year, but at the end of October, Mars halts this apparent motion and then appears to reverse course. From November to late January, Mars is in retrograde. About every two years, Mars appears to change its direction\u2014an illusion caused by the motion of our planet in its orbit passing by the Red Planet in its orbit.Lastly, look to the skies for a beautiful show throughout October and November as the Orionid meteor shower is active, peaking on the night of Oct. 20. Expect the shower to produce 10-20 meteors per hour at its peak, under clear, dark skies. This year, the Moon will be about 20% full on peak nights so it will interfere slightly but shouldn\u2019t totally spoil the show\u2014best of all, you can observe the meteor showers without any special equipment.

The T-38 is a two-engine jet that can hold two crew members together and reach speeds as high as Mach 1.2, making it faster than the speed of sound. The T-38, which can fly to heights of 50,000 feet/15,240 meters, is used for aerobatic maneuvers to help the astronauts become adjusted to unusual attitudes that they might experience in space. They also manage real risks in real time that helps prepare for quick decision making in the harsh environment of space. Since the Apollo era, astronauts have received dedicated training in the T-38.Working together in flight is similar to how the crew might work together in their Orion spacecraft. The Artemis II mission will send @NASAastronauts @Astro_Reid, @AstroVicGlover, and @astro_christina, and @CanadianSpaceAgency astronaut @AstroJeremy on a 10-day flight test around the Moon. This first crewed mission back to the Moon will set the tone as we look forward to establishing a long term presence on the lunar surface with #Artemis.

Well, you\u2019ve got two options\u2013but coming soon, you might have a third. \u2604There are currently two methods for slowing down a spacecraft when landing; which option to choose (or if you use them together) depends primarily on how much atmosphere your landing site has.The first option, retropropulsion, is best used when there is little to no atmosphere to help slow down a spacecraft. Retropropulsion is where you use thrusters pointed down at the surface of the planet to slow yourself down as you're coming in\u2014like those used by the Apollo missions.The second option, heat shields, is used if you do have an atmosphere, which makes slowing down much easier, as the atmosphere acts as a giant brake as you slow down. In this scenario, a heat-resistant shield is on the blunt end of your spacecraft as it travels through the atmosphere. Finally, once the heat shield has sufficiently slowed the spacecraft, parachutes are deployed to slow it down the rest of the way for a safe landing.However, teams are working on a brand-new third method called Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD). Much like a traditional heat shield, HIAD can deploy to slow a spacecraft through the atmosphere, but unlike a traditional heat shield, it is fabricated out of a highly compactable flexible woven system instead of the bulky ceramics or metals of past missions. The result: improved heat shield results at a fraction of the space and weight. Set to launch Nov. 1, 2022, with @NOAA\u2019s #JPSS2 mission, LOFTID will demonstrate this new heat shield's ability to slow down and survive atmospheric entry.Producers: Scott Bednar, Jessica WildeEditor: Daniel SalazarCredit: NASA#NASA #Technology #LOFTID #HeatShield #Space #Spacecraft #Atmosphere #Science #Parachute #Thrusters #Apollo"

Solar winds carry the energetically charged particles from these events to Earth\u2019s atmosphere. When these particles seep through Earth's magnetosphere, a part of our atmosphere that protects us from solar and cosmic radiation, they cause substorms. These fast-moving substorm particles slam into our thin, high atmosphere, colliding with Earth's oxygen and nitrogen particles. As these air particles shed the energy they picked up from the collision, each atom starts to glow in a different color\u2014causing the brilliant ribbons of light which weave across Earth's northern or southern polar regions. Typically, auroras are visible closer to Earth\u2019s poles, where the magnetosphere is generally weakest; however, when the Sun releases especially powerful solar storms, auroras can be seen further from the poles. Just that happened this past week when a powerful geomagnetic storm delighted skywatchers with auroras as far south as Virginia and Arizona! Video description: The northern lights as seen from the International Space Station. The video begins with the green hues of the northern lights dancing across the skies of North America. The curvature of the Earth is visible where the auroras in the atmosphere meet the darkness of space. As the video continues it moves further southeast across North America, revealing the bright lights of cities across the midwest United States.

The preliminary post-flight data indicates that all SLS systems performed exceptionally and that the designs are ready to support a crewed flight on Artemis II.\tThe Artemis II mission will bring us closer to establishing a sustained human presence on the lunar surface and landing the first woman and the first person of color on the Moon.\tThis video was captured from the Launch Pad 39B perimeter and was used by engineers to monitor and track the rocket during flight.\tVideo credit: NASAMusic credit: Universal Production MusicCover photo: NASA/Chris Coleman and Kevin Dav\t#MegaMoonRocket #Launch #SpaceLaunchSystem #LunarMission #STEM #NASA #Space #Liftoff #Rocket #NASAKennedy"

With records as early as 1880, we have been working together with @NOAA to track Earth\u2019s global temperature as part of our work monitoring climate change. This year contributed to an unprecedented, but well-understood trend in which the last eight years have been the warmest ever recorded. 2021 was tied for the sixth warmest year since our records began. This can be correlated to human activities, like burning fossil fuels which adds to greenhouse gasses, such as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere where they trap more heat.  Since about 1850, humans have raised atmospheric CO2 by nearly 50%. Our climate is driven by heat and the energy it carries, influencing our weather, droughts, intense tropical cyclones and more. In 2021, Earth saw several extreme examples of how excess heat in the ocean and atmosphere can influence often devastating, sometimes unexpected, disasters in different parts of the world.

From small, rocky Earth-sized worlds to gas giants many times larger than Jupiter, we've been looking for more than 30 years to find these exoplanets' subtle signals: the dimming of a distant star as a planet passes in front of it, or a small shift in the star's movement from its planet's gravity.With new telescopes like @NASAWebb and cutting-edge technology, we're discovering more worlds than ever\u2014and even starting to capture direct images. We're learning that there are likely hundreds of billions of planets across the Milky Way!This video is a sonification of all 5,005 confirmed exoplanets, turning their discovery over time into music-like sound. As each exoplanet is discovered, a circle appears at its position in the sky. The size of the circle indicates the relative size of the planet's orbit and the color indicates which planet detection method was used to discover it: pink corresponds to radial velocity, purple to planetary transit, green to microlensing, red to timing variations, yellow to orbital brightness modulation, gray to astrometry, and blue to disk kinematics.The music is created by playing a note for each newly discovered world. The pitch of the note indicates the relative orbital period of the planet. Planets that take a longer time to orbit their stars are heard as lower notes, while planets that orbit more quickly are heard as higher notes. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/M. Russo, A.

Like many people, I mistakenly thought of these Arctic waters as pristine and without an abundance of pollution. This, however, is not the case. Plastic waste generated in other parts of the world is carried to these waters by ocean currents, winds, and sea ice, so while these arctic regions may not produce large amounts of plastic waste locally, plastics accumulate there from distant sources. Another aspect of this issue is indeed local, as the fishing and shipping industries contribute to plastic pollution in the region. These challenges are compounded by microplastics, smaller than 5mm long, which come mostly from sewerage water and are extremely dangerous to all living beings\u2014both inside and out of the ocean. While the issue of ocean plastics is overwhelming and certainly daunting, I was extremely grateful to learn more about the many ways in which we can work together to decrease the quantity of plastics in our ocean.

Underwater sound pollution presents itself in many forms, the most serious of which are products of the oil and gas industry, ocean mining, seismic surveys, and the shipping industry. Underwater sound pollution disrupts marine life by interfering with vital communication, navigation, and hunting behaviors, such as echolocation. Loud noises from ships, construction, and other industrial activities can cause stress, disorientation, and even physical harm, leading to dislocation, reduced reproduction rates, and even death in some cases. In Norway, I was able to learn more from Heike and her students about this urgent environmental challenge and what can be done to reduce the volume of noise we emit in our ocean in order to prevent further distress to marine life. | #PradaReNylon represents innovation in spirit and responsibility in action, reaching beyond the confines of conventional fashion.

Only when the moment felt right did he take a deep breath and slip beneath the waves, quietly descending 40 feet on a single breath.As he lined up his shot, everything fell into place for a perfect, tender moment: A skirt of remoras clung to the mother\u2019s waist, her calf nestled under her chin, and her nearly 14-foot-long pectoral fin lifted slightly. He filmed for as long as his lungs would permit before silently bidding them both farewell.The warm waters off Tonga\u2019s coast serve as a sanctuary for humpbacks and their young, providing critical breeding and calving grounds secluded from the threat of speeding ships. Once newborns like this one are strong enough, they begin the long journey back to their feeding grounds in Antarctica. Nicklen says some free dives are so mesmerizing that you forget the burning in your lungs. This was one of them.Follow @paulnicklen for more stories from beneath the surface.

It is so precise, multiple people messaged me asking if it was computer generated. It\u2019s not fake, but it would be nearly impossible to see this forest in real life. It\u2019s found on Enderby Island, one of the most remote places on the planet. Close to 300 miles (480 km) south of New Zealand\u2019s mainland, Enderby is part of the Auckland Islands and one of the rare pest-free islands where endemic species can thrive without fear of being killed by the countless invasive mammals people brought to this part of the world. Yellow-eyed penguins can be found on Enderby, as well as New Zealand sea lions and birds with songs that resemble video-game sound effects. If you turn your sound on, you can hear one from a bellbird.For those bewildered by the term \u201ccrown shyness,\u201d this phenomenon of certain tree species occurs when the trees\u2019 crowns do not touch each other, forming a distinct pattern among their canopies. If you\u2019d like to learn more insights into the natural world, follow along @michaelgeorge."
